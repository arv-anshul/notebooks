# Marimo Notebooks

A new open-source project as an alternative of Jupyter Notebooks which solves some well-known probelms ([Marimo Blog]).
Before installing marimo in local you can use it in your browser as well at [marimo.app].

I generally use VSCode's Notebooks feature instead of Classic Jupyter UI or Jupyter Lab or this Marimo.
